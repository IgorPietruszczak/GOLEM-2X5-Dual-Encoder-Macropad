# GOLEM-2X5-Dual-Encoder-Macropad
This repository contains an open-source design for The GOLEM 2x5 Dual Encoder Macropad.

Encoder Knob 3d model is taken from this wonderful user from Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4206617/
I scaled up it's hole by 5% to better fit my encoders.

Some KiCAD assets are borrowed from this youtuber: https://www.youtube.com/@joe_scotto/featured
